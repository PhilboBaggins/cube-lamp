# Lamp board

A PCB that holds the electronics for the lamp. It is designed to fit inside the base of the lamp stand.

The board has 3 red, 3 green and 3 blue LEDs, each controlled by FET driven by a separate GPIO lines. The intention is to drive the LEDs with PWM to create a wide range of colours.

A Raspberry Pi Pico micro-controller board is mounted on the bottom of the PCB. The Pico is powered from USB. Firmware could be written to control the LEDs independantly or from commands send from a computer of USB. A Pico-W could be used instead of a Pico to allow the lamp to be controlled over WiFi or Bluetooth.
