## Design notes

There are several models of the stand. All were designed in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and saved as `Cube lamp stand.blend`. Each model was exported from Blender as an `.stl` file:

| Model                             | Description                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Cube lamp stand-Stand_1.stl`     | Largest model. Based on a half sphere when the hole for the resin  cube cut into it                               |
| `Cube lamp stand-Stand_2.stl`     | Shorter, flatter model. Basically a disk with the resin cube sitting mostly on top of it (not recessed in deeply) |
| `Cube lamp stand-Stand_2_001.stl` | A more rounded version of `Cube lamp stand-Stand_2.stl`                                                           |
